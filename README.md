# PortfolioWebsite
Final front-end project: Creating a portfolio website using REACT
The website is also coded for mobile view; changing the vw will also showcase that.
There is a navigation bar that sends you to each section.
In certain sections there are hidden links that will work such as the contact section where
once you click on the click it will go to the corresponding contact.
